## Deployment
**Changelog and versioning**
The version number of this application is controlled automatically via a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/zkoppert/Carl-the-llama/blob/839c75cc367e452414ca5974ff6d5db609679159/.github/workflows/deploy.yml#L20). No need to edit this manually.

The [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file is also controlled automatically via a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/zkoppert/Carl-the-llama/blob/839c75cc367e452414ca5974ff6d5db609679159/.github/workflows/deploy.yml#L36). No need to edit this manually.

**NPM Package Delivery**

Each time that a push to master occurs, a package will be deployed to GitHub Packages with the new code. This is accomplished via GitHub Actions. Check out the [workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) that makes the magic happen.

**AWS Production Deployment**

Deploying to production is currently a manual process. There is a [request](https://github.com/zkoppert/Carl-the-llama/issues/59) to automate it. It can be accomplished with the following command.

`serverless deploy`
